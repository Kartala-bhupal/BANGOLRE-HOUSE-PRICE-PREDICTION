# BANGOLRE-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION 
 The objective of the "Bangalore House Price Prediction" project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in Bangalore, India. The model will be trained on a dataset that includes relevant features such as the size of the house, location, number of bedrooms and other factors that influence house prices. By analyzing historical data and patterns, the model will learn to make predictions on the prices of houses based on input variables. The ultimate goal is to create a model that can assist real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions about property investments in Bangalore.
